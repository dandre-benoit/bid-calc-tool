# The Bid Calculation Tool

## Acknowledgement
- For something that simple, it should have been all normaly made in the frontend with at best the backend providing the cached configuration file generated by a CMS from a database
- The decision here has been made to calcul the cost in the backend so that we have something interesting to show in PHP and Laravel
    - As if it was complex or an IP or using a third party like an AI or something
- A database with tables could have been used instead of a config php files
    - But it takes more time to do so here
    - The database would have look something like this:
        - vehicule_types
            - notes
                - Each row would have represent a vehicule type
                - The first row would have been the default values and would not have a name
                - A one to many relationship would have been created with associate_fee_ranges
                - Then a eager loading could have been made to query all the ranges for each vehicule type
            - columns
                - id UNSIGNED BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT
                - name VARCHAR NULLABLE UNIQUE
                - basic_fee_rate FLOAT NULLABLE
                - basic_fee_min_usd FLOAT NULLABLE
                - basic_fee_max_usd FLOAT NULLABLE
                - special_fee_rate FLOAT NULLABLE
                - storage_fee_usd FLOAT NULLABLE
                - active TINYINT DEFAULT 1
                - updated_at TIMESTAMP
                - created_at TIMESTAMP
                - deleted_at TIMESTAMP
        - association_fee_ranges
            - columns
                - id UNSIGNED BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT
                - vehicule_type_id UNSIGNED BIGINT
                - higher_than_price_usd FLOAT
                - fee_usd FLOAT
                - active TINYINT DEFAULT 1
                - updated_at TIMESTAMP
                - created_at TIMESTAMP
                - deleted_at TIMESTAMP
- No naming convention has been applied for the CSS (yolo)
    - Minimum styling and layout
        - The logo of Progi and its color been used
        - Didn't want to lose time there
    - No library has been used, just to show some raw SCSS skill with media queries
    - I normaly use BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention
- More time spent on unit tests
